// this is kinda like a testing
//  today class we learnt about how does a JS code works
//  so the structure behind it is :

//  ⬇ next step
//  ↳ about it
//  ➥ points of it
//  ⮚ terms of it

//  the code is passed through a programme called parser
//                           ⬇
//  the code will be converted into a JS object called as AST whom full form is Abstract syntax tree
//       ↳ it represents the often source code written in a formal language
//                           ⬇
//  it passes to a programme called callstack
//       ↳ it is a mechanism for interpreter which keeps the track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions
//     ➥ the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function
//     ➥ any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached
//     ➥ when the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the call stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing
//    ⮚ compiler translates the entire source code in a single run Or it translates the entire source code in JIT stands for Just In Time
//       ↳ translates into byte code that the machine understands and can execute
//    ⮚ interpreter translates the entire source code line by line
//       ↳ is used in contrast cause we don't have a compiler
//                           ⬇
//  the variables and functions are stored in memory
//                           ⬇
//  executable byte - code gets generated
//                           ⬇
//  the code gets executed
